            <p id="RepairGuide">This website contains stitches and mends I know and often use on my clothing. Using a
                needle and thread is deeply human and all of the fabrics we wear have been put together by a person.
                Repairing clothes brings a sense of connection to daily material objects and it’s an opportunity to
                co-design with the humans who make our garments. I believe we should all possess some level of skill to
                bring new life to our clothes.</p>

            <p id="ladderStitch-intro" >A ladder stitch or an invisible stitch is used to take in fabric, this is an accessible and easy way to
                alter
                pants yourself at home. This technique involves creating a series of small, parallel stiches along
                the existing
                seam line which resemble the steps of a ladder. This stitch is discreet and durable, it could also be
                removed
                easily.</p>

           <!--<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>--> 

           
            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <p>
                Start with trying on your jeans and using a measuring tape to determine the necessary adjustment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mark a point X inches away from the straight seam on the side of the jeans, this point should be right
                along the
                top of the jeans.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mark another point where the pocket meets the straight seam.
            </p>


            <p>
                Connect the points making a diagonal line with the chalk and mark the straight line. Both lines should
                make a
                triangle.
            </p>


            <p>
                Get a needle and thread ready – loop thread through needle and make a knot.
            </p>


            <p>
                Start from the inside of the jeans puncturing the point at the pocket and bringing the thread outside
                of the
                jeans.
            </p>


            <p>
                Next, sew above the previous point following the straight seam, keep your needle parallel to the
                fabric,
                pointing
                to the top of the jeans and go in then out.
            </p>


            <p>
                Parallel to the stich previously made make the same stitch on the angled marked side.
            </p>

            <p>
                Go back to the straight seam and make the same stich.
            </p>


            <p>
                Go to angled line and make the same stitch.
            </p>


            <p>
                Do this all the way to the top of the jeans.
            </p>


            <p>
                Your last stitch should have the needle and thread inside the jeans.
            </p>


            <p>
                Pull the thread until the fabric comes together and you can’t see the stitch anymore.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finish with a knot on the inside and cut.
            </p>

            <h2 id="Buttons">BUTTONS - REATTACH BUTTON</h2>
            <p>Fixing a button or adding a button for decoration is an easy skill to learn and pretty useful! You can
                use an extra button that came with your garment, sometimes found on the tag of your garment. You can
                also use another random button for fun! Whatever you like!</p>

            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <p>Position button, sometimes there are marks indicating where it was</p>

            <p>Thread the needle and tie a knot at the end. The length of your thread should be 1.5 times the size of
                your wrist. </p>

            <p>Start from the inside of the garment hiding the knot on the inside.</p>

            <p>Bring the needle through one of the buttonholes, then down through the opposite hole. Repeat this a few
                times between the two buttonholes making sure it’s tight and secure.</p>

            <p>If the button is meant to sit above the fabric (like on a coat), you might want to create a shank. To
                do this, after sewing the button on securely, but before finishing off the thread, place a toothpick
                or a matchstick horizontally on top of the button. Wrap the thread around the toothpick a few times,
                then sew through the fabric underneath to secure the shank. Remove the toothpick and finish off the
                thread.</p>

            <p>Once the button is securely attached, finish off the thread by making a few small stitches underneath
                the button. Tie a knot close to the fabric and trim any excess thread.</p>

            <p>Make sure the button is secure by gently tugging on it.</p>

            <p>You can use a bit of fabric glue / super glue / clear nail polish on the knot to ensure the button does
                not fall off again. </p>
