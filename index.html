            <p >This website contains stitches and mends I know and often use on my clothing. Using a
               needle and thread is deeply human and all of the fabrics we wear have been put together by a person.
               Repairing clothes brings a sense of connection to daily material objects and it’s an opportunity to
               co-design with the humans who make our garments. I believe we should all possess some level of skill to
               bring new life to our clothes.

               <p id="ladderStitch-intro">A ladder stitch or an invisible stitch is used to take in fabric, this is an
                  accessible and easy way to alter pants yourself at home. This technique involves creating a series of small, parallel stiches along
                  the existing seam line which resemble the steps of a ladder. This stitch is discreet and durable, it could also
                  be
                  removed
                  easily.

               <h2 class="instructions">INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
               <p>
                  1. Start with trying on your jeans and using a measuring tape to determine the necessary adjustment.
               </p>
               <p>
                  2. Mark a point X inches away from the straight seam on the side of the jeans, this point should be
                  right
                  along the
                  top of the jeans.
               </p>
               <p>
                  3. Mark another point where the pocket meets the straight seam.
               </p>
               <p>
                  4. Connect the points making a diagonal line with the chalk and mark the straight line. Both lines
                  should
                  make a
                  triangle.
               </p>
               <p>
                  5. Get a needle and thread ready – loop thread through needle and make a knot.
               </p>
               <p>
                  6. Start from the inside of the jeans puncturing the point at the pocket and bringing the thread
                  outside
                  of the
                  jeans.
               </p>
               <p>
                  7. Next, sew above the previous point following the straight seam, keep your needle parallel to the
                  fabric,
                  pointing
                  to the top of the jeans and go in then out.
               </p>
               <p>
                  8. Parallel to the stich previously made make the same stitch on the angled marked side.
               </p>
               <p>
                  9. Go back to the straight seam and make the same stich.
               </p>
               <p>
                  10. Go to angled line and make the same stitch.
               </p>
               <p>
                  11. Do this all the way to the top of the jeans.
               </p>
               <p>
                  12. Your last stitch should have the needle and thread inside the jeans.
               </p>
               <p>13. Pull the thread until the fabric comes together and you can’t see the stitch anymore.
               </p>
               <p>
               14. Finish with a knot on the inside and cut.

               <h2 id="Buttons">BUTTONS - REATTACH BUTTON</h2>
               <p>Fixing a button or adding a button for decoration is an easy skill to learn and pretty useful! You
                  can
                  use an extra button that came with your garment, sometimes found on the tag of your garment. You can
                  also use another random button for fun! Whatever you like!
               </p>
               <img class="sewbutton" src="imgs/sew-button.png" alt="Sewing Button">
               <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
               <p>1. Position button, sometimes there are marks indicating where it was</p>
               <p>2. Thread the needle and tie a knot at the end. The length of your thread should be 1.5 times the size
                  of your wrist. 
               </p>
               <p>3. Start from the inside of the garment hiding the knot on the inside.</p>
               <p>4. Bring the needle through one of the buttonholes, then down through the opposite hole. Repeat this a
                  few times between the two buttonholes making sure it’s tight and secure.
               </p>
               <p>5. If the button is meant to sit above the fabric (like on a coat), you might want to create a shank. To
                  do this, after sewing the button on securely, but before finishing off the thread, place a toothpick
                  or a matchstick horizontally on top of the button. Wrap the thread around the toothpick a few times,
                  then sew through the fabric underneath to secure the shank. Remove the toothpick and finish off the
                  thread.
               </p>
               <p>6. Once the button is securely attached, finish off the thread by making a few small stitches underneath
                  the button. Tie a knot close to the fabric and trim any excess thread.
               </p>
               <p>7. Make sure the button is secure by gently tugging on it.</p>
               <p>8. You can use a bit of fabric glue / super glue / clear nail polish on the knot to ensure the button
                  does not fall off again.

               <h2 id="HolesRips">DARNING A HOLE</h2>
               <p id="holes-rips-intro">Darning is a useful technique to know for repairing holes or areas on your
                  clothing that have become worn, it can be used to prevent holes as well. It is a traditional method
                  for repairing clothes that has been around forever! There are specific materials you can get for
                  darning, but I have always just used any regular needle I can find and the same colored thread as
                  the garment. I find it fun to watch a TV show and darn a pair of socks I’m emotionally attached to.
                  As with all the stitches/repairs on this site, the more you practice the cleaner the results will
                  be! 
               </p>
               <img class="darn" src="imgs/darning.png" alt="darning-hole">
               <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
               <p>1. Place a tennis ball or whatever object under the area you will need to provide support.</p>
              <p>2. Optionally use chalk to mark around the hole or worn area to create a guide that you will sew within.</p>
               <p>3. Prepare your needle and thread: cut a length of thread appropriate for the size of the hole – 2x the
               size of your wrist is a good length in most cases. Thread the needle, doubling the thread and tie a
               knot with the 2 ends.</p>
               <p>4. Start your needle at the fabric near the edge of the hole. Sew evenly spaced vertical stitches covering the hole these are the warp threads which will form a foundation.</p>
               <p>Next are weft threads which are the threads going in the opposite direction (horizontal) which will
               
               weave through the straight stitches just made.</p>
               <p>5. Now keeping the needle parallel to the fabric weave the needle in and out of the fabric across the
               hole, the aim is to fill in the hole with this woven pattern. Keep weaving until the fabric is reinforced.</p>
               <p>6. After darning the hole, sew a few additional stitches around the edges to secure the threads in place. Knot the thread on the backside of the fabric and trim any excess.</p>

               <h2 id="Hem">Hem</h2>
               <p id="hem-intro">Hemming is a fundamental sewing skill which allows you to adjust the length of your
                  garment and is a great way to hide/repair frayed edges. The same stitch can be applied to many
                  different clothing items such as a pair of pants, the length of a dress, torn hems, sleeves, etc.
                  Hemming is a simple stitch that ensures your clothes fit perfectly and look polished.
               </p>
               <img class="Hem" src="imgs/hem.png" alt="Hemming">
               <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
               <p>1. Using a ruler measure from the existing hemline how much to hem and mark on both sides of the fabric, connect the two marks to make a straight line. You can cut excess fabric if needed.</p>
               <p>2. Fold the edge of the fabric up to the marked hemline, fold inwards putting the inside fabric together.</p>
               <p>3. Press this fold with an iron to create a crisp edge and your new hemline.</p>
               <p>4. Secure the folded hem in place with pins, this helps create a straight stitch and prevents the fabric from moving around.</p>
               <p>5. Using a straight stitch, sew along the folded edge at the end of the fabric keeping the stitches even and maintaining a consistent distance from the edge.</p>
               <p>6. Once the hem is sewn, press it again to set the hem and create a smooth crisp line.</p>
